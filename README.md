# TCGplayer to Archidekt Cardlist Translator
Translates the lists of cards output by the TCGplayer app scanner and translates it to a format readable by Archidekt. This allows you to import a TCGplayer scan into Archidekt.

## Features
* Translates from TCGplayer cardslist to Archidekt cardslist
* Option to include collector number (Archidekt does not currently support collector number imports, not recommended at this time)
* Option to append ``Maybeboard`` to the end of each card line, allowing you to add the cardlist to a deck as a maybeboard

## Use
1. Paste TCGplayer output into the left field of the translator
2. Select the options you want to use
3. Click "Translate"
4. Copy the output and paste into Archidekt
